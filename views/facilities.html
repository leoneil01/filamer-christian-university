                    Previously, it was the school's dormitory for the students of the College of Nursing. In 1979, the site gave way for the construction of the Roblee Hall that instantly became the favorite venue for socio-cultural programs not only of Filamer but for the entire province of Capiz. Today, below the hall are found the office of the Dean of the College of Criminal Justice Education and its various laboratories, the Science laboratories, the offices of the ROTC and Security.
